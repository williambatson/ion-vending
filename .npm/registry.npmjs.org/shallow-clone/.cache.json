Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/shallow-clone.svg?style=flat&label=Travis)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/shallow-clone)\n\n> Creates a shallow clone of any JavaScript value.\n\nPlease consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save shallow-clone\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst clone = require('shallow-clone');\n```\n\n**Supports**\n\n* arrays\n* objects\n* dates\n* maps\n* sets\n* buffers\n* symbols\n* array buffers\n* float32 arrays\n* float64 arrays\n* int16 arrays\n* int32 arrays\n* int8 arrays\n* uint16 arrays\n* uint32 arrays\n* uint8clamped arrays\n* uint8 arrays\n* regular expressions\n* errors\n* primitives\n\n## Arrays\n\nBy default, only the array itself is cloned, use [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep) if you also need the elements in the array to be cloned.\n\n```js\nconst arr = [{ a: 0 }, { b: 1 }];\nconst foo = clone(arr);\n// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\n\n// array is cloned\nassert(actual === expected); // false\n\n// array elements are not\nassert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true\n```\n\n## Objects\n\nOnly the object is shallow cloned, use [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep) if you also need the values in the object to be cloned.\n\n```js\nclone({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });\n//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n```\n\n## RegExp\n\nClones regular expressions and flags, and preserves the `.lastIndex`.\n\n```js\nconst re = clone(/foo/g); //=> /foo/g\n// you can manually reset lastIndex if necessary\nre.lastIndex = 0;\n```\n\n## Primitives\n\nSimply returns primitives unchanged.\n\n```js\nclone(0); //=> 0\nclone('foo'); //=> 'foo'\n```\n\n##
