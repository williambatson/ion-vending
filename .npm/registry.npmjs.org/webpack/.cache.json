The Webpack v1.x [documentation can be found here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=top).\r\n\r\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\r\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\r\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\r\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\r\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\r\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\r\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\r\n\r\n### Get Started\r\n\r\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\r\n\r\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\r\n\r\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\r\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\r\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\r\n**flexible**.\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[common-chunks-webpack-plugin][common]|![common-npm]|Generates chunks of common modules shared between entry points and splits them into separate  bundles (e.g vendor.bundle.js && app.bundle.js)|\r\n|[extract-text-webpack-plugin][extract]|![extract-npm]|Extracts Text (CSS) from your bundles into a separate file (app.bundle.css)|\r\n|[compression-webpack-plugin][compression]|![compression-npm]|Prepares compressed versions of assets to serve them with Content-Encoding|\r\n|[i18n-webpack-plugin][i18n]|![i18n-npm]|Adds i18n support to your bundles|\r\n|[html-webpack-plugin][html-plugin]|![html-plugin-npm]| Simplifies creation of HTML files (`index.html`) to serve your bundles|\r\n\r\n\r\n[common]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/CommonsChunkPlugin.js\r\n[common-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\r\n[extract]: https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin\r\n[extract-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/extract-text-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[component]: https://github.com/webpack/component-webpack-plugin\r\n[component-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/component-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[compression]: https://github.com/webpack/compression-webpack-plugin\r\n[compression-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/compression-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[i18n]: https://github.com/webpack/i18n-webpack-plugin\r\n[i18n-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/i18n-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[html-plugin]: https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin\r\n[html-plugin-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/html-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n\r\n### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)\r\n\r\nwebpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle\r\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\r\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\r\n\r\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\r\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Files\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|Loads raw content of a

This makes webpack fast\r\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\r\n\r\n### Module Formats\r\n\r\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\r\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\r\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\r\n\r\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\r\n\r\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\r\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\r\n\r\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\r\n\r\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\r\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\r\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\r\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\r\nfriendly** by using hashes.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\r\n\r\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo.

Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\r\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\r\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\r\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\r\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\r\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\r\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\r\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\r\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\r\n\r\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\r\n\r\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\r\n\r\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\r\n\r\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\r\n\r\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\r\n\r\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\r\n\r\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\r\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\r\n\r\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\r\n\r\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\r\n        <p>Core</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\r\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

It makes development and applications faster and it reduces the required bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThis is how we use the donations:\r\n\r\n* Allow the core team to work on webpack\r\n* Thank contributors if they invested a large amount of time in contributing\r\n* Support projects in the ecosystem that are of great value for users\r\n* Support projects that are voted most (work in progress)\r\n* Infrastructure cost\r\n* Fees for money handling\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Premium Partners</h2>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t\r\n<a href=\"https://www.ag-grid.com/?utm_source=webpack&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=sponsorship\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/2b399d58/horiz-banner-ad-ag-grid.png\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Other Backers and Sponsors</h2>\r\n\r\nBefore we started using OpenCollective, donations were made anonymously.

@google for [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\r\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\r\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\r\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\r\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\r\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\r\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\r\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\r\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\r\n\r\n\r\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\r\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\r\n\r\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\r\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\r\n\r\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\r\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\r\n\r\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\r\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\r\n\r\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\r\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\r\n\r\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\r\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\r\n\r\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\r\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\r\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","gitHead":"df65475ba32a5881f48ab9d90e1c010ea57c3d65","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@4.0.0-beta.1","_npmVersion":"5.6.0","_nodeVersion":"8.9.4","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-+Qghq7TiXoDRXFmdZ5jJ/jRx6ruQnVUh3ecy59en6/zcssB0t75UWkPXsPeOXNC8WoCiQLcCqu0cobKcgSanKA==","shasum":"a7a39c794d46005eaeeadae94d8e8ce0caf9a1a2","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-4.0.0-beta.1.tgz","fileCount":313,"unpackedSize":1073088},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_4.0.0-beta.1_1518271865430_0.40973825889218096"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"3.11.0":{"name":"webpack","version":"3.11.0","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\r\n  <p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\r\n\r\nInstall with npm:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall with yarn:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn add webpack --dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n> This README reflects Webpack v2.x and v3.x. The Webpack v1.x documentation has been deprecated and deleted.\r\n\r\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\r\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\r\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\r\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\r\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\r\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\r\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\r\n\r\n### Get Started\r\n\r\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\r\n\r\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\r\n\r\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\r\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\r\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\r\n**flexible**.\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[common-chunks-webpack-plugin][common]|![common-npm]|Generates chunks of common modules shared between entry points and splits them into separate  bundles (e.g vendor.bundle.js && app.bundle.js)|\r\n|[extract-text-webpack-plugin][extract]|![extract-npm]|Extracts Text (CSS) from your bundles into a separate file (app.bundle.css)|\r\n|[compression-webpack-plugin][compression]|![compression-npm]|Prepares compressed versions of assets to serve them with Content-Encoding|\r\n|[i18n-webpack-plugin][i18n]|![i18n-npm]|Adds i18n support to your bundles|\r\n|[html-webpack-plugin][html-plugin]|![html-plugin-npm]| Simplifies creation of HTML files (`index.html`) to serve your bundles|\r\n\r\n\r\n[common]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/CommonsChunkPlugin.js\r\n[common-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\r\n[extract]: https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin\r\n[extract-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/extract-text-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[component]: https://github.com/webpack/component-webpack-plugin\r\n[component-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/component-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[compression]: https://github.com/webpack/compression-webpack-plugin\r\n[compression-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/compression-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[i18n]: https://github.com/webpack/i18n-webpack-plugin\r\n[i18n-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/i18n-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[html-plugin]: https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin\r\n[html-plugin-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/html-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n\r\n### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)\r\n\r\nwebpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle\r\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\r\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\r\n\r\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\r\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Files\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|Loads raw content of a

This makes webpack fast\r\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\r\n\r\n### Module Formats\r\n\r\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\r\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\r\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\r\n\r\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\r\n\r\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\r\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\r\n\r\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\r\n\r\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\r\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\r\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\r\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\r\nfriendly** by using hashes.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\r\n\r\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\r\n\r\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\r\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\r\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\r\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\r\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\r\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\r\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\r\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\r\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\r\n\r\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\r\n\r\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\r\n\r\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\r\n\r\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\r\n\r\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\r\n\r\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\r\n\r\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\r\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\r\n\r\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\r\n\r\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\r\n        <p>Core</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\r\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

If you use webpack for a serious task, and you'd like us to invest more time on it, please donate. This project increases your income/productivity too. It makes development and applications faster and it reduces the required bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThis is how we use the donations:\r\n\r\n* Allow the core team to work on webpack\r\n* Thank contributors if they invested a large amount of time in contributing\r\n* Support projects in the ecosystem that are of great value for users\r\n* Support projects that are voted most (work in progress)\r\n* Infrastructure cost\r\n* Fees for money handling\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Premium Partners</h2>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t\r\n<a href=\"https://www.ag-grid.com/?utm_source=webpack&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=sponsorship\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/2b399d58/horiz-banner-ad-ag-grid.png\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Other Backers and Sponsors</h2>\r\n\r\nBefore we started using OpenCollective, donations were made anonymously.

The Webpack v1.x documentation has been deprecated and deleted.\r\n\r\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\r\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\r\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\r\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\r\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\r\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\r\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\r\n\r\n### Get Started\r\n\r\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\r\n\r\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\r\n\r\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\r\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\r\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\r\n**flexible**.\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[common-chunks-webpack-plugin][common]|![common-npm]|Generates chunks of common modules shared between entry points and splits them into separate  bundles (e.g vendor.bundle.js && app.bundle.js)|\r\n|[extract-text-webpack-plugin][extract]|![extract-npm]|Extracts Text (CSS) from your bundles into a separate file (app.bundle.css)|\r\n|[compression-webpack-plugin][compression]|![compression-npm]|Prepares compressed versions of assets to serve them with Content-Encoding|\r\n|[i18n-webpack-plugin][i18n]|![i18n-npm]|Adds i18n support to your bundles|\r\n|[html-webpack-plugin][html-plugin]|![html-plugin-npm]| Simplifies creation of HTML files (`index.html`) to serve your bundles|\r\n\r\n\r\n[common]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/CommonsChunkPlugin.js\r\n[common-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\r\n[extract]: https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin\r\n[extract-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/extract-text-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[component]: https://github.com/webpack/component-webpack-plugin\r\n[component-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/component-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[compression]: https://github.com/webpack/compression-webpack-plugin\r\n[compression-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/compression-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[i18n]: https://github.com/webpack/i18n-webpack-plugin\r\n[i18n-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/i18n-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[html-plugin]: https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin\r\n[html-plugin-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/html-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n\r\n### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)\r\n\r\nwebpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle\r\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\r\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\r\n\r\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\r\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Files\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|Loads raw content of a file (utf-8)|\r\n|[val-loader][val]|![val-npm]|Executes code as module and considers exports as JS code|\r\n|[url-loader][url]|![url-npm]|Works like the file loader, but can return a Data Url if the file is smaller than a limit|\r\n|[file-loader][file]|![file-npm]|Emits the file into the output folder and returns the (relative) url|\r\n\r\n\r\n[raw]:

This makes webpack fast\r\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\r\n\r\n### Module Formats\r\n\r\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\r\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\r\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\r\n\r\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\r\n\r\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\r\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\r\n\r\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\r\n\r\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\r\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\r\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\r\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\r\nfriendly** by using hashes.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\r\n\r\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\r\n\r\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\r\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\r\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\r\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\r\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\r\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\r\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\r\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\r\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\r\n\r\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\r\n\r\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\r\n\r\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\r\n\r\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\r\n\r\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\r\n\r\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\r\n\r\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\r\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\r\n\r\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\r\n\r\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\r\n        <p>Core</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\r\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

@google for [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\r\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake.

The Webpack v1.x [documentation can be found here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=top).\r\n\r\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\r\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\r\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\r\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\r\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\r\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\r\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\r\n\r\n### Get Started\r\n\r\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\r\n\r\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\r\n\r\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\r\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\r\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\r\n**flexible**.\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[common-chunks-webpack-plugin][common]|![common-npm]|Generates chunks of common modules shared between entry points and splits them into separate  bundles (e.g vendor.bundle.js && app.bundle.js)|\r\n|[extract-text-webpack-plugin][extract]|![extract-npm]|Extracts Text (CSS) from your bundles into a separate file (app.bundle.css)|\r\n|[compression-webpack-plugin][compression]|![compression-npm]|Prepares compressed versions of assets to serve them with Content-Encoding|\r\n|[i18n-webpack-plugin][i18n]|![i18n-npm]|Adds i18n support to your bundles|\r\n|[html-webpack-plugin][html-plugin]|![html-plugin-npm]| Simplifies creation of HTML files (`index.html`) to serve your bundles|\r\n\r\n\r\n[common]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/CommonsChunkPlugin.js\r\n[common-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\r\n[extract]: https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin\r\n[extract-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/extract-text-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[component]: https://github.com/webpack/component-webpack-plugin\r\n[component-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/component-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[compression]: https://github.com/webpack/compression-webpack-plugin\r\n[compression-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/compression-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[i18n]: https://github.com/webpack/i18n-webpack-plugin\r\n[i18n-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/i18n-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n[html-plugin]: https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin\r\n[html-plugin-npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/html-webpack-plugin.svg\r\n\r\n### [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)\r\n\r\nwebpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle\r\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\r\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\r\n\r\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\r\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Files\r\n\r\n|Name|Status|Description|\r\n|:--:|:----:|:----------|\r\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|Loads raw content of a

This makes webpack fast\r\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\r\n\r\n### Module Formats\r\n\r\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\r\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\r\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\r\n\r\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\r\n\r\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\r\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\r\n\r\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\r\n\r\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\r\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\r\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\r\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\r\nfriendly** by using hashes.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\r\n\r\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\r\n\r\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\r\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\r\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\r\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\r\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\r\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\r\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\r\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\r\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\r\n\r\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\r\n\r\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\r\n\r\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\r\n\r\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\r\n\r\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\r\n\r\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\r\n\r\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\r\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\r\n\r\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\r\n\r\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\r\n        <p>Core</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\r\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\r\n      </td>\r\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\r\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

If you use webpack for a serious task, and you'd like us to invest more time on it, please donate. This project increases your income/productivity too. It makes development and applications faster and it reduces the required bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThis is how we use the donations:\r\n\r\n* Allow the core team to work on webpack\r\n* Thank contributors if they invested a large amount of time in contributing\r\n* Support projects in the ecosystem that are of great value for users\r\n* Support projects that are voted most (work in progress)\r\n* Infrastructure cost\r\n* Fees for money handling\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Premium Partners</h2>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t\r\n<a href=\"https://www.ag-grid.com/?utm_source=webpack&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=sponsorship\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/2b399d58/horiz-banner-ad-ag-grid.png\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Other Backers and Sponsors</h2>\r\n\r\nBefore we started using OpenCollective, donations were made anonymously.

@google for [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\r\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\r\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\r\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\r\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\r\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\r\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\r\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\r\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\r\n\r\n\r\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\r\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\r\n\r\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\r\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\r\n\r\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\r\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\r\n\r\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\r\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\r\n\r\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\r\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\r\n\r\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\r\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\r\n\r\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\r\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\r\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","gitHead":"cce33c206abaeef26d06b62102adf74a989a4696","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@3.12.0","_npmVersion":"5.6.0","_nodeVersion":"8.11.1","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-Sw7MdIIOv/nkzPzee4o0EdvCuPmxT98+vVpIvwtcwcF1Q4SDSNp92vwcKc4REe7NItH9f1S4ra9FuQ7yuYZ8bQ==","shasum":"3f9e34360370602fcf639e97939db486f4ec0d74","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-3.12.0.tgz","fileCount":282,"unpackedSize":919368,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nyqaE\r\n=JIX4\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_3.12.0_1526050296958_0.27947974454418567"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.8.2":{"name":"webpack","version":"4.8.2","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\nInstall with yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack --dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\n\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

If you use webpack for a serious task, and you'd like us to invest more time on it, please donate. This project increases your income/productivity too. It makes development and applications faster and it reduces the required bandwidth.\n\nThis is how we use the donations:\n\n* Allow the core team to work on webpack\n* Thank contributors if they invested a large amount of time in contributing\n* Support projects in the ecosystem that are of great value for users\n* Support projects that are voted most (work in progress)\n* Infrastructure cost\n* Fees for money handling\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Premium Partners</h2>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ag-grid.com/?utm_source=webpack&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=sponsorship\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/2b399d58/horiz-banner-ad-ag-grid.png\">\n</a>\n\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Other Backers and Sponsors</h2>\n\nBefore we started using OpenCollective, donations were made anonymously.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.0","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-dycVcffNaebFKI5Y6yv4yvtzAqr6MahHMBo58I9+YZQUAlf8x7sjVwFbCzxtEKLR3DAihJeQ7RscpqEQqimpuQ==","shasum":"6fdd442932ff232da783e629f2ffcf29a571b533","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.0.tgz","fileCount":386,"unpackedSize":1742571,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\n8G4q\r\n=vEDX\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.0_1545401951672_0.48712448862592006"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.28.2":{"name":"webpack","version":"4.28.2","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\nInstall with yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack --dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\n\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake.

You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack.

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.3","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-9F8ZKS8+q+NVU8516RThPiMrDrcaIO4fctkC0V8Va/q16rEvcBonbN71OTuWz+Ewh6SwaVD8fWmQD6gW/mQMPw==","shasum":"2330734b1f175703f3069c1cf5d4f80b688f76b7","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.3.tgz","fileCount":387,"unpackedSize":1753641,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nn6aZ\r\n=Z0es\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.3_1546103682282_0.3082951998939669"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"5.0.0-alpha.4":{"name":"webpack","version":"5.0.0-alpha.4","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\nInstall with yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack --dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\n\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.4","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-w9PjVxNeS9HD0tZnjBvLpCd6zWFiq1sJZLjRxJqs7cLXB6zbZxQxJU+28xZpCkBwF5BO7MwqvF15zi1IJRJfMQ==","shasum":"35e83292e5429a50d2b57c1949860525b52f6c0b","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.4.tgz","fileCount":386,"unpackedSize":1757661,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nzDVJ\r\n=8lAC\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.4_1546956623244_0.42053628818791444"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"5.0.0-alpha.5":{"name":"webpack","version":"5.0.0-alpha.5","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\nInstall with yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack --dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\n\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.5","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.15.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-Ezr0fyJ8npRuyY7YB8oOeAk6wd+UIc2RSAW6GzZQvQgfgyI88tFrweGseh+Lb2/65oMhjKi7ju7rdV8CziWN5g==","shasum":"e60233c9c7732fee5a75348276d166c2678fbbc8","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.5.tgz","fileCount":387,"unpackedSize":1768202,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nwo1r\r\n=DQEN\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.5_1547043679950_0.3594489930837461"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.28.4":{"name":"webpack","version":"4.28.4","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\nInstall with yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack --dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\n\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.6","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.15.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-76Vd6D4eq06N9TfB6nVjlGldcddwm3H9wQTq/nIFBPf0g9i95gbGiBvf04HkqhiyD8+GsoSAUDj67G7CDnLdrA==","shasum":"1f17d4e5b1be4769efafa7631f227aede52231ae","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.6.tgz","fileCount":387,"unpackedSize":1770439,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nOYBj\r\n=5mwE\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.6_1547570404398_0.671680826299941"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"5.0.0-alpha.7":{"name":"webpack","version":"5.0.0-alpha.7","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\nInstall with yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack --dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\n\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

If you use webpack for a serious task, and you'd like us to invest more time on it, please donate. This project increases your income/productivity too. It makes development and applications faster and it reduces the required bandwidth.\n\nThis is how we use the donations:\n\n* Allow the core team to work on webpack\n* Thank contributors if they invested a large amount of time in contributing\n* Support projects in the ecosystem that are of great value for users\n* Support projects that are voted most (work in progress)\n* Infrastructure cost\n* Fees for money handling\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Premium Partners</h2>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ag-grid.com/?utm_source=webpack&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=sponsorship\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/2b399d58/horiz-banner-ad-ag-grid.png\">\n</a>\n\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Other Backers and Sponsors</h2>\n\nBefore we started using OpenCollective, donations were made anonymously.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.7","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.15.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-0d/NMdRH06K8F/GjdSuEjfb6XJRK6u29tDrlYqpGEo9eCorWqZ0n2DK69xid0IfCPqzCuInuljeSDK8KWN1RJA==","shasum":"49aa29aeaa97f6c794b1454ba918add1ec1bec8e","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.7.tgz","fileCount":387,"unpackedSize":1776218,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nuctA\r\n=v6/B\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.7_1547899894153_0.5927023770148421"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"5.0.0-alpha.8":{"name":"webpack","version":"5.0.0-alpha.8","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Install</h2>\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack\n```\n\nInstall with yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add webpack --dev\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Introduction</h2>\n\nwebpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.8","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-rkbK5i86IDGE86GUTFat1T5VApDYxPDpdXK40Zz6fOnZxtAE4kNPZOzE0YEyA00J+lZgnECqRiYo5LkHMOOS3Q==","shasum":"773359ad463a3c46a7171d70ffb4e712ec848c09","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.8.tgz","fileCount":387,"unpackedSize":1776265,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\nbjr9\r\n=BFsZ\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.8_1547925926942_0.5577210536729686"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.29.0":{"name":"webpack","version":"4.29.0","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of it's flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.9","_npmVersion":"6.5.0","_nodeVersion":"11.7.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-uH0N6eCvE/p1g3ga+byQZ8vMrnfKoOzI0uo4mLtDEfjbORO2SDrAjFCXKw/rMME9irlySUd76kMfD5fdiJm0Qw==","shasum":"3d30ba2c53140c130cffd22b7173d3435c0a2839","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.9.tgz","fileCount":392,"unpackedSize":1789415,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\ndMlk\r\n=yOmo\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.9_1548591554464_0.12283683999004591"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.29.1":{"name":"webpack","version":"4.29.1","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

for [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.10","_npmVersion":"6.5.0","_nodeVersion":"11.7.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-fv2rODEmS3mVttLV26uDnlkZBiNLFFi2OuUUxoHJ8ZxT4TWI+PRwNwCESWCmK5zmNIFTMu6tjJflJetLvmCQJA==","shasum":"21e75c3ae302cd36da11adf218185a467fdea4ba","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.10.tgz","fileCount":393,"unpackedSize":1801939,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\npZbE\r\n=t9Qb\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.10_1549529487184_0.48040925636688314"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.29.4":{"name":"webpack","version":"4.29.4","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

for [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://img.shields.io/david/webpack/webpack.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[tests]: https://img.shields.io/travis/webpack/webpack/master.svg\n[tests-url]: https://travis-ci.org/webpack/webpack\n\n[builds-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/webpack/branch/master\n[builds]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/webpack/webpack?svg=true\n\n[builds2]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_apis/build/status/webpack.webpack\n[builds2-url]: https://dev.azure.com/webpack/webpack/_build/latest?definitionId=3\n\n[licenses-url]: https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_shield\n[licenses]: https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=shield\n\n[cover]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/webpack/webpack.svg\n[cover-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/webpack/webpack/\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues"},"_id":"webpack@5.0.0-alpha.11","_npmVersion":"6.4.1","_nodeVersion":"10.15.1","_npmUser":{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-ZKCTHaNy7BBkczezC3fdaOGSP/IPzsXplM2xlsppvt9Jo9gtovKsWEFzvl4pCANBI5msmDYYUT7X/8YsVp4MMg==","shasum":"ebca9d79dce46165ddacdc99ff0b5b0388f4e62b","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/webpack/-/webpack-5.0.0-alpha.11.tgz","fileCount":393,"unpackedSize":1802379,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\njr6D\r\n=Nbg3\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jhnns","email":"mail@johannesewald.de"},{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"},{"name":"thelarkinn","email":"sean.larkin@cuw.edu"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/webpack_5.0.0-alpha.11_1550573451093_0.4926840171774649"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"4.29.6":{"name":"webpack","version":"4.29.6","author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"description":"Packs CommonJs/AMD modules for the browser.

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Bundles [ES Modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/get-started/) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nwebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nwebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]|![mini-css-npm]|![mini-css-size]|Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|Name|Status|Install Size|Description|\n|:--:|:----:|:----------:|:----------|\n|[raw-loader][raw]|![raw-npm]|![raw-size]|Loads raw

Performance\n\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nwebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n* Spelling or grammar fixes\n* README.md corrections or redesigns\n* Adding unit, or functional tests\n* Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n* [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n* Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n* [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n* Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.
